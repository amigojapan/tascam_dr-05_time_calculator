                I have a simple math question (warning I am terrible at math) I have a recorder,
                I know it can make recordings of 1 hour 2 minutes and 6 seconds per file,
                when a file ends it automatically starts the next file, if I know the start
                time and the "mark time", what would be the formula to get which file and what 
                time of that file the "mark time” is at in that file? this is not homework, it 
                is a problem I am trying to solve for an actual recorder I have, but I can’t seem 
                to get the right value… please give me a layman’s answer, not a mathematicians answer

something seems to be wrong cause when I enter 00:00:00 as the start time and 16:00:00 as the mark time I
get "in file:16 time in file:00:28:30” but just looking at the minutes, 28 minutes seems off cause 2 minutes 
times 16 is 32 minutes, and it should even be 33 minutes I think because the seconds being 6 seconds times 16 would 
be 90 seconds, which is over a minute, what am I doing wrong?

monoprotic:amigojapan: 15 files takes 15*(01:02:06) = 15:31:30

monoprotic:amigojapan: so 15 are complete; the end point is in the 16th file, 16:00:00 - 15:31:30 = 00:28:30 into it

amigojapan: is the program output correct then?

monoprotic:amigojapan: it seems to be, i think you're just confused about what the output is
